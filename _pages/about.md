## About Me

Hello! I’m **Prratham Kamat** and I kind of believe that life is a struggle. Not just for me, but for everyone. The only difference is whether we choose the right struggles early enough for the results to compound as we grow older. I chose to struggle early. Ever since I can remember, I did things differently: selling apparel, flipping water bottles for twice the price at concerts, even building websites at 17 just to make that extra buck. These small hustles did two things for me — they sharpened my curiosity about how businesses work and built a hunger to eventually create something meaningful for people. That pursuit of trying different ventures naturally led me into marketing.

I’ve always believed education is lifelong, and not forced, which is exactly why I skipped my IIT-JEE exam. I knew I’d make a terrible engineer, so I chose what I genuinely enjoyed: a Bachelor’s in Economics at Christ University. It was my “Farhan moment” from 3 Idiots. Studying economics gave me clarity on how markets behave, how decisions shape outcomes, and how businesses grow (or don’t).

In my third year, I built a marketing outreach agency that I scaled to a profitable margin. I designed and executed multi-channel outreach campaigns for tech, consulting, and HR B2B clients — consistently achieving 70–80% open rates and 3–4% reply rates across large-scale prospect lists. Soon, my agency and consulting services were paying me far more than any company visiting campus, so I didn’t sit for placements.

I later worked as a Marketing Consultant at Ticombo, a European secondary ticketing company. That role exposed me to the entire marketing spectrum, from SEO long-form content pipelines to market analysis, brand narrative building, influencer-led campaigns, and creator partnerships for major events.

Every great thing ever built was built because someone had a vision, deep passion for it, and the willingness to go through short-term pain, the kind of "struggle" that compounds multifold over time. I am looking for a place where I can contribute to that kind of vision, grow fast, solve exciting problems, and be part of a team that believes in shared success.
